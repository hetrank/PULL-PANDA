Here are three concise reviews:

**Review A**: This code refactors global variables into a Pydantic settings class, improving configuration management and validation. The new implementation is more robust and maintainable.

**Review B**: The updated config_manager.py file introduces environment-based configuration with validation, feature flags, and a singleton instance. This redesign enhances flexibility, security, and code readability.

**Review C**: The commit replaces hardcoded configs with a Pydantic Settings class, adding validation, feature flags, and environment support. This change improves code organization, reduces errors, and enhances overall system configurability.

Comparing these reviews for clarity, correctness, and actionability, I select:

**Best Review: Review C**
Reason: I picked Review C because it concisely summarizes the key changes and benefits of the commit, providing a clear and actionable overview of the improvements.
