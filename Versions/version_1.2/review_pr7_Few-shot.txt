- Bug: `fetch_from_source` may throw on null key.
- Suggestion: Add null-check and early return, add unit test.

- Code style: inconsistent naming `get_data` vs `get`.
- Suggestion: follow project lint rules and rename `get_data` to `get` for consistency.

- Performance: `AdvancedCache` uses `OrderedDict` which can be slow for large caches.
- Suggestion: consider using a more efficient data structure, such as a `functools.lru_cache` or a dedicated caching library.

- Security: `AdvancedCache` uses `hashlib.md5` which is not cryptographically secure.
- Suggestion: consider using a more secure hash function, such as `hashlib.sha256`.

- Code organization: `AdvancedCache` has a mix of cache management and decoration logic.
- Suggestion: consider splitting the cache management and decoration logic into separate classes or modules for better modularity and reusability.

- Test coverage: no tests are provided for `AdvancedCache`.
- Suggestion: add unit tests and integration tests to ensure the cache is working correctly and efficiently.
