**Summary**: This PR introduces an asynchronous data fetcher using aiohttp with a retry mechanism, replacing the old synchronous implementation.

**Critical Bugs**:
1. The `fetch_with_retry` function does not handle specific exceptions that may occur during the fetch operation. It should catch and handle exceptions like `aiohttp.ClientError` or `asyncio.TimeoutError` separately. 
   ```python
try:
    return await async_fetch_data(session, url)
except aiohttp.ClientError as e:
    # Handle client errors
except asyncio.TimeoutError as e:
    # Handle timeouts
```

**Important Improvements**:
1. The `fetch_multiple_sources_async` function does not handle the case where `asyncio.gather` returns a mix of results and exceptions. It should be modified to handle this scenario.
   ```python
results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
for result in results:
    if isinstance(result, Exception):
        # Handle the exception
    else:
        # Process the result
```

**Code Quality & Maintainability**:
1. The `fetch_with_retry` function uses a magic number for the maximum number of retries. Consider defining a constant for this value.
   ```python
MAX_RETRIES = 3
async def fetch_with_retry(session, url, max_retries=MAX_RETRIES):
```
2. The `fetch_data` and `async_fetch_data` functions do not log or handle the case where the response is not JSON. Consider adding error handling for this scenario.
   ```python
try:
    return response.json()
except ValueError as e:
    # Handle the error
```

**Tests & CI**:
1. There are no tests visible in this diff. Consider adding unit tests to cover the new functionality, especially the retry mechanism and error handling.

**Positive notes**:
1. The introduction of an asynchronous implementation with aiohttp is a significant improvement over the old synchronous implementation.
2. The addition of a retry mechanism with exponential backoff is a good practice for handling transient failures.
